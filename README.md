STAT547M Homework 9
=============

This repository was initially seeded by a makefile pipeline by Jenny Bryan. I have made the following changes and additions for Homework 9:

1. Created an R script to create a table of the most frequent letters in each word
1. Create a bar plot illustrating the frequency of occurence of each letter
1. Modified the Rmd file with a summary of my own analyses
1. Modified the Makefile to be able to reproduce all of the above
