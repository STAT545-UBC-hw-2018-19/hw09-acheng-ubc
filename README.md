STAT547M Homework 9
=============

This repository was initially seeded by a makefile pipeline by Jenny Bryan. I have made the following changes and additions for Homework 9:

1. Created an R script to create a table of the most frequent letters in each word
1. Create a bar plot illustrating the frequency of occurence of each letter
1. Modified the Rmd file with a summary of my own analyses
1. Modified the Makefile to be able to reproduce all of the above

The final report output from this analysis pipeline can be viewed right on GitHub [here](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw09-acheng-ubc/blob/master/report.md), but it is recommened to download the [report.html](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw09-acheng-ubc/blob/master/report.html) file for viewing instead.
